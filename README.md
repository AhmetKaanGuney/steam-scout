[SteamScout Website](https://steam-scout.firebaseapp.com/)

## Inroduction
SteamScout is a web app that allows you to browse unpopular/old games that are on Steam.
It uses [SteamAppsDB](https://github.com/AhmetKaanGuney/steam-apps-db) (a public Web API that I created) to get information about the games.

### Motivation:
I wanted to develop my JavaScript and React skills.
I also wanted to develop a web app specifically for mobile phones.
Then I started to think about what kind of web app should I develop.
Well I'm really into games and I often find myself browsing indie games.
Steam is a great platform to browse games but after a while I realised that same popular 
games are always popping up in my browsing list.
To pass throgh those games you gotta search really deep.
So I thought why not make a website that contains *only* unpopular games.
Maybe there are some hidden gems in there.

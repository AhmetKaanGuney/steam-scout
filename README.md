[SteamScout Website](https://steam-scout.web.app/)

## Inroduction
SteamScout is a web app for browsing undiscovered, unexplored and overlooked<br>
games that are on Steam. It uses [SteamAppsDB](https://github.com/AhmetKaanGuney/steam-apps-db) (a public Web API that I created) <br>
to get the information about the games.

### Motivation:

I wanted to develop a mobile web app that will strengthen my JavaScript<br>
and React skills. I'm very interested in video games and I often find <br>
myself browsing Steam. Steam is a great platform to browse games but <br>
after a while I realised that the same popular games are always at the <br>
top of my browsing list. And discovering hidden gems takes a lot of <br>
time. So I thought why not make a website that only contains games under <br>
one million owners (approximately).That way you can browse a lot of <br>
games that you haven't been exposed to.<br>
